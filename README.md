## **About**
This repository contains my solutions to the NeetCode problem sets. Each solution includes:
- The problem statement (linked to the original problem on LeetCode).
- My approach and explanation.
- Optimized code implementation in a chosen programming language.

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey while helping others understand various problem-solving techniques.

## **Folder Structure**
The repository is structured by topics (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Graphs) and further divided into individual problems:

```
📂 NeetCode-Solutions/
│
├── 📂 Arrays/
│   ├── TwoSum.java
│   ├── MaximumSubarray.py
│   └── README.md
│
├── 📂 Strings/
